# Planifier
Planifier (French for *to plan*) is a web application that lets teachers post their lesson plans for colleagues or students to see. Teachers, students, or administration can use the site to browse lesson plans by course or by teachers. All content is user-generated, but protected by mandatory login. 

# Why Planifier?
During my teaching career, sharing resources and plans with my colleagues kept me both sane and inspired. Sharing among colleagues fosters school community and leads to greater creativity when it comes to lesson planning. I hope this application will help teachers help each other!

# Frameworks and Technologies
Planifier is a Sinatra web application written with Ruby, ERB, HTML, and CSS. Data is managed and manipulated with ActiveRecord and SQLite3.
